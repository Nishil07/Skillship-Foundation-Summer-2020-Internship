# Skillship-Foundation-Summer-2020-Internship
This is about the projects I worked on for the successful completion of my first ever internship at Skillship Foundation in the Machine Learning domain. I hope whoever comes across this repository they get an insight about how the industry works.
## No Show for an Appointment
This repository contains a dataset of patients showing up or not showing up for his/her appointment. I took various factors into consideration and applied 2-3 Machine Learning algorithms in order to get the most accurate predictions.
## Student employment status and salary prediction
This project is based on a dataset that contains the academic history of a student and against this it contains the information about his/her employment and salary status.
## Capstone Project Credit Card Fraud Detection
This is the topic which i chose to display my skills that I learned over the two months while being an intern at Skillship Foundation. I loaded a dataset from Kaggle where a bank had provided them with some good information about a fraud or no-fraud transaction via the bank's online portal.
